## Process Details

### 1. Transaction Processing
1. **Transaction Detection**: SMS parsing or manual entry captures transaction
2. **Data Extraction**: Amount, merchant, date, and description extracted
3. **ML Categorization**: Transaction sent to ML service for automatic categorization
4. **Confidence Assessment**: System evaluates categorization confidence
5. **Category Assignment**: High-confidence transactions auto-categorized, low-confidence flagged for review

### 2. Reward Calculation
1. **Card Matching**: System identifies user's credit cards applicable to transaction
2. **Rate Calculation**: Reward rates calculated for each card based on category
3. **Optimization**: Algorithm determines which card maximizes rewards
4. **Reward Computation**: Actual rewards calculated based on optimal card selection
5. **Balance Update**: User's reward balance updated with earned rewards

### 3. Real-time Updates
1. **Notification**: User notified of transaction and rewards earned
2. **Dashboard Update**: Real-time updates to web and mobile dashboards
3. **History Tracking**: Transaction and reward history maintained
4. **Analytics**: Spending patterns and reward optimization insights generated

## Reward Categories

### Cashback Rewards
- **Percentage-based**: 1-5% cashback on eligible purchases
- **Category-specific**: Higher rates for specific spending categories
- **Tiered structure**: Different rates based on spending thresholds
- **Immediate credit**: Cashback applied to statement or account

### Points Rewards
- **Points per dollar**: 1-3 points per dollar spent
- **Category multipliers**: Bonus points for specific categories
- **Redemption options**: Points convertible to cash, travel, or merchandise
- **Point valuation**: Dynamic point-to-dollar conversion rates

### Miles Rewards
- **Miles per dollar**: 1-2 miles per dollar spent
- **Airline partnerships**: Miles transferable to partner airlines
- **Travel redemption**: Miles used for flights, upgrades, or travel expenses
- **Elite status**: Miles contributing to airline elite status

### Percentage Rewards
- **Fixed percentage**: Consistent reward rate across all purchases
- **Category bonuses**: Enhanced rates for preferred categories
- **Statement credits**: Rewards applied as statement credits
- **Annual caps**: Maximum rewards per year with rollover options

## Optimization Algorithm

### Multi-Card Strategy
1. **Card Portfolio Analysis**: Evaluate all user's credit cards
2. **Category Mapping**: Match transaction categories to card benefits
3. **Rate Comparison**: Compare reward rates across all applicable cards
4. **Optimal Selection**: Choose card with highest reward potential
5. **Future Planning**: Suggest optimal card usage for upcoming transactions

### Spending Pattern Analysis
1. **Historical Data**: Analyze past spending patterns
2. **Category Distribution**: Identify primary spending categories
3. **Reward Optimization**: Suggest card combinations for maximum rewards
4. **Strategy Recommendations**: Provide personalized card usage advice
